                  <http://saga-project.org/download/adaptors/condor>


  For detailed informations on how to install SAGA, please refer 
  to the documentation section on our website:

    http://saga-project.org/documentation 


  PREREQUISISTES:
  
  o SAGA Core Components
    You have to install the SAGA Core Components before you can install the
    Python Bindings. The Core Components are available on the SAGA website.

  o Boost C++ Libraries >= 1.33
    You need to have the Boost C++ libraries installed on your system. Many
    systems already provide binary packages for them. If your system doesn't 
    you can download the source from http://www.boost.org and build it yourself.
    
 
  BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE CONDOR ADAPTOR
 
  The Condor Adaptor comes with a configure/make-based buildsystem. There are 
  two useful options for ./configure:

    --boost-location= The location of your Boost installation
                      (e.g. /usr/local/packages/boost-1.42). You only
                      need this option if boost is *not* installed in
                      the default path (/usr/ or /usr/local
    --with-condor     The location of your Condor installation. You 
                      only need this option if boost is *not* installed 
                      in the defaul path (/usr/ or /usr/local)

  For a complete list of configure options, you can typ

    ./configure --help
 

  To configure, build and install the Condor Adaptor, make sure that 
  $SAGA_LOCATION points to your SAGA Core Components installation and
  execute ./configure and make:

    $> export SAGA_LOCATION=/PATH/TO/SAGA_CORE_INSTALLATION
    $> ./configure --with-boost=/BOOST/DIR/ --with-condor=/CONDOR/DIR
    $> make
    $> make install



  Please help us to improve the quality of SAGA and file a bug report if you
